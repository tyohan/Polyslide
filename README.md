# Polyslide
###HTML5 Slide Presentation Template Using Polymer 1.0.

##Overview
This template made for demo and slide presentation purpose. If you usually do presentation and demo with HTML5 app it's take some effort to switch between your browser and keynote, or even between tabs.
Using browser based slides make you easier to show the demo without switch window or tab. You can just put the demo inside the slide.

##Polymer
By using Polymer, it's more compact to make your demo. You can write your HTML5 demo on separate HTML file and import it with HTMLImport. This Polyside based on [Polymer starter kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit) so you can follow instruction from there how to setup.
